### Hey there, I'm Jared ðŸ‘‹ 

**I began my career as an IT tech...** but ended up enjoying programming so much that in 2019 I began an education in Computer Science.

**Most of my experience in school has been with Java...** however, I have become a fan of Python since I began my graduate studies. This is because I realized my passion in Computer Science is Robotics and Machine Learning, and have been predominately using Python for many of my projects! 

**Outside of school...** I have had experience as a Full-Stack web dev and know my way around the ASP.NET framework and AngularJS.

**When not coding...** I'm an ambitious ultra-cyclist who races for Team Athletic Mentors!

The programming languages I'm most proficient in are: 
  - C#
  - Java
  - Python
  - SQL

If I was stranded on a desert island and had to choose one food to eat, my top three picks would be:
- Oatmeal
- Pizza
- Deli Sandwiches
