## Hey there, I'm Jared ðŸ‘‹ 

### I began my career as an IT tech...
but ended up enjoying programming so much that in 2019 I began an education in Computer Science.

### Most of my experience in school has been with Java... 
however, I have become a fan of Python since I began my graduate studies. This is because I realized my passion in Computer Science is Robotics and Machine Learning, and have been predominately using Python for many of my projects! 

### When not coding... 
I'm reading, enjoy time with friends or hiking.

The programming languages I'm most proficient in are: 
  1. Kotlin
  2. Java
  3. Python
  4. C#
  5. Transact SQL

If was I stuck on a desert island with only one book, my top three picks would be:
  1. *The Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius
  2. *Dune* by Frank Herbert
  3. *The Last Night of the Earth Poems* by Charles Bukowski
